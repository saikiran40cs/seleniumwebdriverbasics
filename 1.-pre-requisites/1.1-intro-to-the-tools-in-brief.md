# 1.1 Intro to the Tools in brief

**1. Selenium IDE**

The Selenium IDE is an add-on to Firefox. At a basic level it allows us to:

* Record user actions when browsing in Firefox
* Replay recorded scripts
* Convert recorded scripts into programming languages such as Java, Ruby, and more
* Add verification and synchronization steps to the script during the recording process

  ```text
    The IDE provides excellent support for writing automated test scripts in Selenium and gets better with every release. We will focus on its use as an aid to writing automated test scripts in Java, rather than as a test tool in its own right.
  ```

**2. Java JDK**

Java is a programming language. The Java that we will be using is very simple. If your work environment uses a different language e.g. Ruby, .Net, Python, chances are that you will be able to use Selenium RC in that language. Download Java JDK 1.8 \(32bit/64bit\) as per your eclipse version \(32bit/64bit\)

**3. Eclipse IDE**

Eclipse is a free and open-source IDE, which supports many programming languages. Out of the box it provides many useful support aids for beginning java programmers:

* wizards for code creation
* code completion.
* automatically fix common coding errors
* It is also simple to install, incredibly popular among developers, and has a lot of additional plugins that you can use to increase your productivity.

Download Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developer Edition i.e. Kepler Version of Eclipse\(32bit/64bit\)

**4. Selenium RC**

Selenium Remote Control is the server version of Selenium. You write your tests using a programming language and client library. Your tests issue commands, which the client library sends to the server. The server then performs your actions for you in the browser and reports the results back to your client.

Using Selenium RC allows you to write Automated tests in any supported programming language. Tests written in this way allow you to use standard programming practices to make them easy to maintain, robust and easy to collaborate on as a team.
