# 1.3 Selenium IDE

Selenium IDE gives an idea of how record and playback works in an automation tool. However it's not a tool to completely rely on. Also you cannot make conditional decisions in the selenium IDE, for that purpose we need to get handson with some java programming. Selenium IDE however is very handy for beginners as it can automatically generate boilerplate code for you.
