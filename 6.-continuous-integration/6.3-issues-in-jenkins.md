# 6.3 Issues in Jenkins

One of the error which i faced while running jenkins is:-

**Issue 1: Unable to set the workspace**

**Scenario:** In jenkins if we are unable to set the workspace as you are not the administrator sometimes we cannot run the tests.

**Solution:** There is an advanced field at the time of project setup where in you must select custom workspace option in jenkins so as to run tests from the specified workspace.

**Issue 2: Error occurred during initialization of VM**

**Scenario:** First of all, I have a box with 8gb of ram, so I doubt total memory is the issue. This application is running fine on machines with 6gb or less.I am trying to reserve 3GB of space using -Xmx3G under "VM Arguments" in Run Configurations in Eclipse. Every time I try to reserve more than 1500mb, I get this error: “Error occurred during initialization of VM; Could not reserve enough space for object heap” using -Xmx3G

**Solution:** Here is how to fix it:

**Go to**`Start->Control Panel->System->Advanced(tab)->Environment Variables->System`

```text
Variables->
New:
Variable name: _JAVA_OPTIONS   
Variable value:-Xmx1024M
Variable name:Path
Variable value:;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.121\bin;C:\JDK\bin;
```

Please let me know if you had any other issues
