# Selenium IDE {#selenium-ide}

Selenium IDE gives an idea of how record and playback works in an automation tool. However it's not a tool to completely rely on. Also you cannot make conditional decisions in the selenium IDE, for that purpose we need to get handson with some java programming. Selenium IDE however is very handy for beginners as it can automatically generate boilerplate code for you.

* You can enable the experimental features in Selenium IDE : 
  * Open IDE &gt; Click Options &gt; Click Options &gt; Enable the checkbox with text - "Enable Experimental Features", also the textbox with text - "Disable format change warning messages".
  * Once experimental feature is enabled you can record a test while default html format then convert code to appropriate language by clicking Options &gt; Format and choose the code format of your choice. You can switch back to original table view by choosing HTML as format.

  Hope you enjoy it.
