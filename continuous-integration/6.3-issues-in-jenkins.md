# Common issues in Jenkins {#ant-buildxml}

---

One of the error which i faced while running jenkins is:-

1. **Unable to set the workspace**

 If in jenkins we are unable to set the workspace as you are not the administrator but still there is an advanced feature where in you must select custom workspace option in jenkins so as to set the workspace.

   2. **Error occurred during initialization of VM**

**Scenario:** First of all, I have a box with 8gb of ram, so I doubt total memory is the issue. This application is running fine on machines with 6gb or less.I am trying to reserve 3GB of space using -Xmx3G under "VM Arguments" in Run Configurations in Eclipse. Every time I try to reserve more than 1500mb, I get this error: “Error occurred during initialization of VM; Could not reserve enough space for object heap” using -Xmx3G

**Solution: **Here is how to fix it:

**Go to**`Start->Control Panel->System->Advanced(tab)->Environment Variables->System`

```
Variables->
New:
Variable name: _JAVA_OPTIONS   
Variable value:-Xmx1024M
Variable name:Path
Variable value:;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.121\bin;C:\JDK\bin;
```

Please let me know if you had any other issues
