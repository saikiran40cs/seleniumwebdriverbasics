# Testing Frameworks {#test-frameworks}

Testing framework is necessary to organize our tests. When the count of automated test increases it becomes very tediuos to manage them. Test frameworks provide us with below features.

1. Setting up data before tests run
2. Cleaning up data after tests are finished
3. Creating suites to run multiple tests
4. Externalize configurations from actual scripts
5. Integration with CI server

We will be using TestNG as our framework of choice, however we will also briefly cover a Junit Test.
